# System Overview

Kallipolis is composed of three applications and one database. The two frontends run independently as Next.js apps; the backend and the database are orchestrated together via Docker Compose. This document describes the system at the level a reader needs to hold its shape in their head — what the components are, how they relate, and where the substantive engineering work lives.

## The four components

| Component | Tech | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing page | Next.js 16 + React 19 | 3000 | Marketing site, public entry point |
| Atlas | Next.js 16 + React 19 + Three.js | 3001 | Authenticated interactive 3D visualization |
| Backend | FastAPI + Python | 8000 | API, AI orchestration, Neo4j gateway |
| Database | Neo4j 5.18 | 7687 (bolt), 7474 (browser) | Graph storage |

The landing page and atlas are independent Next.js apps. They share no code and run on different ports. The backend serves both indirectly — only the atlas calls it.

## The graph at the center

Everything in Kallipolis revolves around a single Neo4j graph. The graph holds eight node types and ten directional relationship pairings (built from nine unique relationship type names, with `IN_MARKET` overloaded across College→Region and Employer→Region), encoding the curriculum side and the industry side of the workforce development equation, bridged through skills.

**Curriculum side.** `College → Department → Course → Skill ← Student`. A college offers departments, which contain courses, which develop skills. Students enroll in courses and inherit the skills those courses develop.

**Industry side.** `Region ← College/Employer, Region → Occupation → Skill, Employer → Occupation`. Regions demand occupations with wage and employment metadata. Occupations require skills. Employers hire for occupations.

**The bridge.** `Skill` is the same node type on both sides. A skill that appears in `(:Course)-[:DEVELOPS]->(:Skill)` and `(:Occupation)-[:REQUIRES_SKILL]->(:Skill)` is a bridge skill. It connects what colleges teach to what regional employers need, and partnership opportunities are computed by traversing these bridges.

For the full schema, see [Graph Model](./graph-model.md).

## The AI surface

Kallipolis calls two LLM providers, each for a distinct role.

**Claude** handles linguistic operations against existing data. Five system prompts translate natural language questions into validated Cypher (`backend/llm/query_engine.py`). Two narrative generators write partnership proposals and SWP project sections (`backend/partnerships/generate.py`, `backend/strong_workforce/generate.py`). Both use server-sent events for streaming output.

**Gemini** handles data extraction during the ETL pipeline. Course extraction from PDF catalogs, skill taxonomy mapping, occupation-skill assignment, and employer name cleanup all run on Gemini.

The split is deliberate. Claude is asked to reason about institutional context — gaps, alignments, narratives, voice. Gemini is asked to do high-volume structured extraction from documents. Neither model crosses into the other's role.

For the full treatment of where each model is called and why, see [AI Integration](./ai-integration.md).

## The six API surfaces

The backend exposes one router per ontology unit, each scoped to a single conceptual noun. The four units of analysis each have a router that exposes both deterministic retrieval and Claude-generated Cypher retrieval. The two units of action each have a router that exposes LLM-backed proposal generation, streamed via server-sent events.

| Router | Path prefix | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `students` | `/students/*` | Student roster and detail, NL student query |
| `courses` | `/courses/*` | College and department structure, course listing, NL course query |
| `occupations` | `/occupations/*` | Labor market overview, occupation detail, NL occupation query |
| `employers` | `/employers/*` | Employer listing and detail, NL employer query |
| `partnerships` | `/partnerships/*` | Partnership landscape (read), NL partnership query, targeted proposal generation (streaming) |
| `strong_workforce` | `/strong-workforce/*` | LMI context, SWP project generation (streaming) |

The four analysis-unit routers (`students`, `courses`, `occupations`, `employers`) expose both direct query endpoints (deterministic Cypher) and an NL `/query` endpoint (Claude-generated Cypher with a safety gate). The two action-unit routers (`partnerships`, `strong_workforce`) are AI-driven and stream their output.

For the full endpoint catalog — methods, paths, request shapes, response shapes — see [API Reference](./api-reference.md).

## Streaming

Two endpoints stream their output to the atlas using server-sent events: the partnership proposal generator and the SWP project builder. Both use FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` with `text/event-stream`. The atlas reads them via the Fetch API's `ReadableStream` reader. The SWP stream uses brace-depth JSON parsing to extract complete section objects mid-stream, so each section can be displayed as soon as the model finishes generating it rather than waiting for the entire response. This is why a coordinator using the strong workforce flow sees sections appear progressively rather than all at once.

## Authentication and scoping

Authentication lives in the atlas, not the backend. The atlas issues JWTs via Next.js API routes under `atlas/app/api/auth/`, stores them in HttpOnly cookies, and validates them in a proxy layer (`atlas/proxy.ts`). The backend trusts the atlas — it does not verify tokens itself. All backend endpoints require a `college` query parameter, and Cypher queries are scoped by that parameter. There is no user-level authorization in the backend; college scoping is the only access boundary.

This is appropriate for the product's current stage. The threat model is institutional rather than adversarial: the product is a single-tenant intelligence layer where the principal trust boundary is between colleges, not between users. As the product matures and integrates with multi-stakeholder institutional environments, this boundary will need to be reinforced.

## What lives where

The backend is **feature-primary**: each ontology unit owns a directory containing routes, queries, models, and ingestion code for that unit. Cross-unit infrastructure lives in `ontology/` (graph schema, shared reference data, calibrations) and `llm/` (the NL-to-Cypher engine). `pipeline/` is a thin orchestration layer that imports from features, not the other way around.

Each feature directory follows the same file shape: `models.py`, `api.py`, `query.py` (analysis units) or `generate.py` (action units), `load.py` (when ingested), plus feature-specific scrapers or reference data. For the full per-directory conventions, see [`backend/README.md`](../../backend/README.md).

The landing page lives at the repository root because it was the first thing built. The atlas was added later as a sibling directory rather than being absorbed into the root app, which keeps the two frontends cleanly separated.
