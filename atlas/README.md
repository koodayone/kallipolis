# atlas

Kallipolis atlas. This file is a navigation aid — anything substantive
about the system's shape lives under [`docs/`](../docs/README.md) and
[`atlas/docs/the-structure.md`](./docs/the-structure.md), and is enforced
by the documentation audit. Read [`docs/product/the-atlas.md`](../docs/product/the-atlas.md)
for the product story: what the Atlas is, why it operates at two scales,
and how it relates to the ontology beneath it.

## Layout

The atlas is **feature-primary**: each ontology form and each atlas scale
owns a directory containing everything about it — components, types, API
client, supporting files. Cross-cutting infrastructure lives in small
purpose-named folders (`scene/`, `ui/`, `auth/`, `config/`).

## Feature folder conventions

Each folder under `college-atlas/` follows the same internal shape. Not
every feature needs every file, but when a file exists its name means the
same thing:

```
college-atlas/<form>/
├── <Form>View.tsx     Main component rendered by the form's route
├── <Form>Row.tsx      Optional per-row component (students, courses, …)
├── types.ts           TypeScript types for the feature's domain
└── api.ts             Feature's API client + response types
```

Supporting components specific to one feature (e.g. `ProposalCard.tsx`,
`SwpArtifact.tsx`) live in that feature's folder, not in `ui/`.

## Cross-feature dependencies

```
scene/, ui/, auth/, config/  →  features  →  app/
                                    ↑
                              partnerships (evidence types)
                                    ↓
                              strong-workforce
```

Features may freely import from `scene/`, `ui/`, `auth/`, and `config/`.
The only allowed cross-feature import is `strong-workforce/` → `partnerships/`,
one-way, for shared proposal evidence types and for reading saved partnership
proposals. A SWP project is the *fund* stage of a discovered partnership, so
it consumes partnership output. This mirrors the backend's
`strong_workforce.generate` → `partnerships.generate` direction.

See [`atlas/docs/the-structure.md`](./docs/the-structure.md) for the full
dependency contract and the anti-patterns the layout exists to prevent.

## Running

```bash
# Local dev (port 3001, requires backend running on :8000)
cd atlas && npm run dev

# Production build and start
cd atlas && npm run build && npm run start

# Type check (no emit)
cd atlas && npx tsc --noEmit

# Docs audit (verifies this README's code path references)
python3 tools/docs-audit/audit.py
```

## Where to go next

- **Product docs** — [`docs/product/`](../docs/product/): what each ontology unit *is*, not just what the code does. Start with [`the-atlas.md`](../docs/product/the-atlas.md) for the two-scale framing.
- **Structural reference** — [`atlas/docs/the-structure.md`](./docs/the-structure.md): the principles behind this layout, the folder contract, and the anti-patterns it exists to prevent. Read this before adding, moving, or reorganizing files under `atlas/`.
- **Agent entry point** — [`atlas/CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md): short pointer-style directive that routes agents to `the-structure.md` at decision points.
- **Backend counterpart** — [`backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md): the frontend and backend share the same feature-primary vocabulary. A product doc maps in one hop to both sides.
- **System architecture** — [`docs/architecture/system-overview.md`](../docs/architecture/system-overview.md): three apps, one graph, streaming and auth patterns.
